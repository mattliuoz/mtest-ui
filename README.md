# Front End
## Quick start


## Config
Configure backend service connection at `.env` file<br>
Default value is `REACT_APP_CUSTOMERS_SERVICE_URI=https://localhost:5001`, it should work if your backend service is running at `https://localhost:5001`.<br>

## Kick off frontend
In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm i`

To get all required packages.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

And please make sure change CORS config if you change the default hosting port from `3000` to something else.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

## Notes
I didn't do much on frontend except just have two pages, which are 'add' and 'view top 5'.
I should properly use ESLint and prettier to make my code format better.
